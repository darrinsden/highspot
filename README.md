## SPECIFIC INSTALL NOTES
### prerequisites

I wanted to include a few install notes that i went through. this may not be necessary at all

Since I am unsure what you may be running this on. 
(and the fact that i am running a beta OS)

xcode-select --install
via:
https://ma.ttias.be/mac-os-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path-missing-xcrun/

	sudo npm install npm -g
	npm install -g n

## HIGHSPOT SPECIFIC NOTES
I decided to use react (gatsby) as i was most recently familiar with it

download zip (or clone) from
	https://github.com/darrinsden/highspot

### In terminal
	cd gatsby-site
	npm install
	gatsby develop

### point browser to
	http://localhost:8000

### Observations
Search took a bit as it wasnâ€™t returning what i wanted, modified it a number of different ways. 
	(see TODO for issue)
	
	investigated passing the results to a new page.
		I didnt like that one though and rejected after a bit

Am not spending a super amount of time with design, as the functionality is more important on this.  

And since I am used to working with a designer on the look, it becomes wasted work as the designs dont align.  

As colors are so very much an opinion, I tend to keep things in greyscales at first.

Uploading to github took the longest time though.  as I had some stray existing .git files in directories that were not getting added to the repo

Had a bug with the search when the api returned a small amount of data,
but fixed that this morning

### browser media queries
	displays 4 cards per row by default
	3 cards at 1200px browser width
	2 at 800px
	1 at 500px

### Design TODOS: (suggestions)
    TODO: Add some sort of graphical header to create a bit more impact
	TODO: Add a modal to the cards to display full information OR take them to a new page with that info for the particular card
	TODO: HEADER & SEARCH should stay fixed at the top of the screen possibly have the search as part of the header
	TODO: Add some sort of filtering to the list.. enhanced search
	TODO: loading indicator should be absolutely positioned rather than at bottom of list
    TODO: Possibly employ progressive image techniquies to load the image onto the page

    added a finish indicator when you are done this may need to be updated
    
### Dev TODOS:
	TODO: move search section into its own component

### General Considerations:
    The page may slow down if the data set is much larger... 
    I have not noticed a slowdown, but as more stuff is added to the page, it is likely to happen.
    Suggestion is to perhaps remove items from the top of the list as you scroll down, and then to add items as you scroll up.
    
    This also lends to the approach of have a search theat is always in view.
